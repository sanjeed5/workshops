# Building MVP with AI

Session 1: Plan Your MVP

How to think clearly about MVPs, use AI to brainstorm, and leave with a crisp plan to build your MVP.

---

# Why this session? Why plan first?

- Building is easier now with AI tools, so many jump straight into building. 
- And end up wasting too much time. 
- You can build fast and still build the wrong thing
- Plan to clarify problem, user, and fastest value.
- Build the right thing not just anything fast.

# Agenda

- MVP and how to think about it
- Brainstorming with AI and pitfalls.
- MVP features and next steps
- Q&A

---

# What is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- Smallest version that delivers real value to a specific user
- Validates key riskiest assumptions with minimal effort
- Optimizes for learning speed and shipping speed

---

# MVP principles we will use

- Solve one core job very well
- Ruthlessly cut scope to reduce time to build and learn
- Prefer boring tech that we can ship today
- Ignore scale for now and plan a quick validation

---

# What we will do today

- Use AI to quickly propose a minimal PRD
- Cut scope until it is tiny and sharp
- Explore alternative solutions before committing
- Leverage open source templates to move faster
- Leave with a final PRD that we can build in next session

---

# Guidelines while brainstorming with AI

- AI will often overdo it. Ask for minimal and then cut again
- Prefer one core job. Everything else waits
- Ask AI to clarify before planning. 
- Do not optimize for scale. Optimize for validation speed
- Use high reasoning models while planning.
- Do user research if possible. The nuances matter. 
- Especially if your idea is high effort, while building is easy, it's still better to talk to users first if possible.

---

# Where AI helps today

- Drafts a minimal PRD fast
- Surfaces assumptions and risks
- Suggests alternatives you might not have considered
- Finds reusable templates and boring tech choices

---

# Let's draft the PRD

- Do this on your favorite AI chat app. 
- Mine is Cursor. 
- You can use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any other model. 
- Make sure to use high reasoning models. 

---

# Planning with AI works when you set clear goals

- Without a plan: vague asks force AI to assume details
- With a plan: you set goals and constraints, AI fills gaps
- Plans are living documents. Update as you learn

---

# Prompt: cut scope

```text
Critique this PRD. Remove anything not required to deliver the first user value. Keep very minimal MVP scope only. 
```

---

# Start with why

- Explain purpose before technical details
- Clarify constraints and success signals

Prompt:
```text
What questions should I answer before we start planning the technical implementation?
```

---

# Anatomy of a good plan

- Product: what and why
- Design: look, feel, and core flows
- Engineering: how we build
- DevOps: how we ship

---

# Plan structure that works

- Purpose and success criteria
- Technical foundation and invariants
- Iterative milestones
- Open questions

---

# Break into tasks

- Step 1: explore the problem and list features, decisions, build order
- Step 2: decide stack and scope, then create milestones

```text
Create a detailed plan.md that breaks this into iterative milestones. We don't need estimated timelines. Each milestone should be independently valuable. Include todo checkboxes and mark any open questions. Retain the original purpose and requirements of the project in the plan. After each milestone, have a manual test which confirms that everything works properly for that milestone.
```
---

# Planning checklist

- Could a junior developer understand what to build
- Are milestones truly independent
- Is the definition of done clear for each step
- Are must haves separate from nice to haves
- Where might the AI misunderstand your intent

---

# Decision framework: tools to build your MVP

Pick tools that match skills, needs, and timeline. Short overview:

- AI builders and UI code generators: Lovable, Bolt, v0, Replit, Emergent
- n8n/Gumloop/Zapier: Workflow automation and integrations with drag and drop and code
- Cursor: AI assisted coding in an editor for full control

Guiding questions

1. Coding proficiency: none, intermediate, expert
2. MVP focus: UI, backend logic, automation, or full app
3. Customization need: high control vs guided vs no code

4. Templates to reuse: ask AI to find starters in curated sources

---

# Prompt: find templates and starters

```text
You are a research assistant. Given my MVP description and stack constraints, find 5 open source templates or starters I can reuse. Search these sources: Vercel AI templates, Agno AI examples, OpenAI Cookbook, Mastra examples, LangGraph examples, n8n templates, etc. For each result, include the link, why it fits, setup steps, and any license notes.
```

---

# Next steps

- Start thinking and planning :)
- Start building only after that.

# Thank you

Please share any questions or feedback.

> Btw, these slides were created using Cursor :)
